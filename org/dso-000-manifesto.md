# The Digital State Manifesto

International non-profit organisation aimed an collecting knowledge, digital tools and experiences on how to oppose authoritarian regimes with modern technology, freedom of information and international collaboration.

## History

During the Autumn of 2020 people of Belarus have suffered through a rapid escalation of brutality and terror by their government. Belarus opposition movement is famous for it's lack of violence and "peaceful approach" to regaining their freedom. The small group of activists formed an innitiative "Meta-Belarus" in December of 2020 focusing on using modern technologies and finding creative ways for peolpe to oppose authoritarian rule.

Through working with pople and communities, Meta Belarus has gained much momentum in 2021 and has co-founded The Digital State as an international innitiative aimed to share knowledge of digital freedom-fighters.

## Affiliation

All the materials of "The Digital State" have been produced and provided by the people guided by their free innitiative. The movement is not sponsored by commercial or government and therefore continues to exist in alignment with its initial goals. This is a very important point to re-iterate as it will most certainly challenged by authoritarian regimes (e.g. through fake evidence of movements foreign sponsorship) - so extra care must be maintained not to upsed the control balance of the organisation of "The Digital State".

## Governance

Organisation is controlled under the principles of "scoped holocracy", which adpopts the principles of standard holoclacy, but introduces the concept of "Geographical Scope".

The Digital State operates on a global scope - it does not focus on any specific country, while there are plenty of teams who do so for the specific countries. "Meta-Belarus" - a movement which influenced "The Digital State" continue to focus on freedom fight in Belarus.

The "Hierarchy" describes the geographic scope of effort, rather than control. Under the principles of "holocracy" separate teams have no influence over eachother and we fully respect that. But due to geographics of the effort - there will always be projects at the scale of a "neighbourhood" or "region" while other innitiatives could be on a national or international level.

(ref: More information on "hierarchical holocracy" can be found in dso-001-hierarchical-holocracy.md) 

## Decentralisation

The Digital State and the organisations affiliating with it seek to remove "points of control" at all costs - realising that those would be under the attack by infiltrators or hackers when it is reasonable possible.

This can be achieved through two means - DAO with a voting platform (further discussed in dso-002-dao.md) and principle of redundancy.

Redundancy principle implies that every single individual, server, account, infrastructure, site or device may be compromised and must be "replaceable" with minimum amount of loss and effort. The principle of redundancy is further explanied in dso-003-rendundancy.md. 

Both principles combined allow The Digital State to build a resilient infrastructure of technology and people immune to outside and inside attacks.

## Openness

You might think that creating "closed" innitiative may give advantage to your "patriotic movement" - that is not what we believe. On a contrary, we believe that publicity and openness would give legitimacy and support to your project.

The Digital State is therefore instructs that all efforts, decisions, code and documents must be public and usable by anyone.

## Inclusion

All ouf our projects groups are focused on "inclusion". We encourage people to join the innitiatives and contribute.

For many teams we encourage the use of reputation system to reward good contributors and give them opportunity to have a positive impact on a wide range of innitiatives.

## Individual Identity and Anonymity

We operate under the principles of "Zero-knowledge proof". In other words - we do not store personal information of any collaborator, but we establish means to verify them through public signatures, digital ID sysems or account ownership.

All members must take extra care to maintain their digital identity, but teams and innitiatives will also operate under 2 principles:
- Any member may remain anonymous
- Any identity (real or anonymous) may be compromised
