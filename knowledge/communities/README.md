Creating a difital societty to drive fight for freedom in your country is a dififcult task and requires multiple steps for it to be successful. There are no one 'ready' solution, but there are various ways to get there.

## Communication channels

Before anything else - like-minded pople should be able to communicate freely and safely. Here are some communication options:

### Telegram

Free to use and provides a good resilience, very hard to block. Telegram communication is hosted by the parent company and although their attempt to introduce TON would have enabled fully decentralised solution, it was stopped by U.S. government.

Current practice is that telegram will not interfere in communications unless their own survival is threatened. For instance if the government threatens Apple/Google to take Telegram offline in specific countries, Telegram would not stop communication.

If Telegram is used in your country to communicate by the opposition - make sure to also have sufficient visibility / control around pressure applied on App/Google store by the government.

If Telegram is unavailable in your country - there may be relatively simple ways to get it installed bypassing the store, both Apple and Google have secondary marketplace systems that can be used for free, but they do require some set-up (see https://fixingport.com/best-app-store-alternatives-for-ios/)

### VPN and free internet

If your government blocks websites, make sure to establish a practice of using VPN providers to gain access to basic sites.

### Other solution

Please add other alternatives to "communication-channels.md" and provide only a mention here

 - Signal
 - Facebook

Avoid any platforms on which your government have sufficient influence.

### Labeling and threats

Government will fight free media as "terroristic" or "internationally-sponsored". While it might be quite difficult to disprove those labels, encourage them and advertise them as an "achivemenet". 

### IPFS and Filecoin

It deserves a special mention - look into IPFS technology which should allow you to distribute information across firewalls. Use of browsers such as "Brave" or IPFS plugins for other browsers could allow access to content.

## Public Media

State-controlled media - TV and Radio are often the source of propaganda and missinformation in authoritarian countries. It's crucial to spread a message to avoid watching propaganda and instead choose free press available through available communication channels.

It is very important to understand, that people who are exposed to propaganda will not be ready to just "switch" and it's important to provide a comprehensive training to people on how to convince people to consume the right media. 

### Nation of Leaders

https://nationofleaders.org/ - is an on-line hub in Belarus (in Russian) which offers wide range of training courses for topics such as:
 - leadership
 - anti-propaganda
 - dealing with stress
 - digital safety

Try to distribute your courses through multiple channels - website, youtube, 

### Competing independent media

Helping establishing independent media channels and cross-promoting them should give citizens a choice of various news outlets where they can get up-to-date news. Establish donation schemes so that open-media is funded by the subscribers, which would make them more independent from the influence of the regime.

## Community Hubs

There are several platforms, which can be used by teams to self-organise and work on project remotely:

 - Microsoft Teams
 - Github
 - Slack

Because those platforms are very popular and used by IT companies, government would be unable to block them entirely. And due to SSL encryption, government cannot block individual pages unless they launch "man-in-the-middle" attack, which would only be possible if government controlls SSL certificates installed on devices (which is the case with China).

When setting up Slack or Github - person setting it up could be in a vulterable position and therefore targetted by the hackers. Find a way to host those organisations frorm outside of reach of your government - do not expose information about who is hosting them and their real details.

### DAO

Decentralised Autonomus Organisations is a way to create an organisation which is not controled or administrated by a single person. Here are some notes on how DAO works:

1. All members of DAO use Metamask (or similar) to proove their digital identity
2. DAO can have cryptocurrency acocunt
3. Members may submit "proposals" that other DAO members can vote on.
4. Members vote on proposals based on their influence tokens
4. Proposals may also include financial transactions that originate from DAO account.
5. Any other changes to DAO configuration will also be voted on before they will go in effect

Setting up a DAO is essential if your organisation will be looking to accept crypto donations or must do some kind of decisions. Just make sure to use a blockchain which has low transfer fees.

Probably a most powerful DAO implementation is offered by Aragon.

### Exchange security information

Enlist help of security experts who could validate and help set up infrastruture for your organisations in a safe way.

## Financial starving

Make the aim of your projects to financially starve the authoritarian regime. It's important to start those innitiatives ealy and continue to push the agenda. Methods include:

 - Find ways to avoid paying tax as a sign of protest
 - Provide ways for small business to trade efficiently without support of government
 - Encourage citizens not to buy brands owned by regime
 - Unify community where you can circulate proposals and have wide public reaction - "e.g. boycot and companies or individuals who support regime"
 - Extend your influence of boycotting abroad - reach out to companies who support regime from other democratic countries. Maintain connections with the people who have left the country as they can have physical influence and can set up protest in front of their offices and get noticed by local media.


## Safe destination for data leaks

There are lots of people who are opposing autoritarian regimes and most of them are working as a part of that regime. People are held hostages but they will do steps to fight the regime as long as this is relatively safe for them. Here is what you can do:

 - Create organisations which will collect and host archives of crimes which happen in your country, collecting all thedetails and providing global statistics
 - Make those organisations reachable for whistle-blowers and offer safe ways to accept data leaks
 - Offer maximum exposure for the material you receive


## Sleeper supporters

Find a way how to enlist people as supporter without them constantly following news. Start by making your own petition website, but introduce a "call to action" option. Set ambitious and simple targets at first before doing major events.

Make sure that your supporter cannot be identified through examining their laptop / mobile device by the police and make this information inaccessible.
