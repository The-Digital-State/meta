Modern technology offers many technologies when it comes to creating digital identity. You might have heard about PGP (GPG) keys or SSL certificates. Those are the some fundamental blocks which establish core principles of digital identity management.

Use of digital identity has many benifits - enables anonymity, prevents disinformation, propaganda or fake - but the most difficalt challenge is not technical - it's understanding of digital identity principles by your common folks.

This topic is especially important, now that authoritarian regimes invest into research of deep-fake technology and state-hacking.

## What is Zero Knowledge?

Human interaction is based around recognition - we identify friends by the way how they look, how they sound, act or behave. Our brain stores some reference clues memories of that person and is used to establish authenticy of a given message.

It's not uncommon for certain regimes to trick those senses, replacing their leaders with doubles and nowdays - fabricate videos and voice. As this technology becomes more accessible, it will be used against oposition of the regime.

Luckily - a science field focused on cryptography has given us mechanisms how to create a more reliable ways proove identity.

For example - at one point this document contained a line about a "Quick brown fox", and the history of this was preserved here:

https://github.com/The-Digital-State/meta/commit/a6ac289b391d13a8caa6f1311db7b12f7eb99438#diff-c890d60ca708eb5b8c661712523970608a7e8f64b8b70da1719e865efc6cf6c9R15

But who added that line? The change history of the file indicates that it was signed by a GPG key with ID=0DA7FE21480F206F. You can look this up here: https://keys.openpgp.org/
