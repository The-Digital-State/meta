# About

The Digital State aims to bring concept of blockchain-based DAO (Decentralised Autonomus Organisations) under the control of "Digital Constitution" which would be mutually agreed on by all the parties as well as provide mechanisms of backind out. Here are some features:

 - Anyone may create a new DAO (with just some minimal ammount of crypto)
 - DAOs come with treasury, where DAOs wealth is stored and is controlled by members of DAO.
 - DAO approve all decisions through vote.

On their own - DAOs don't have any binding legislation and therefore would unlikely become "legal" in many country. This is where "Digital Constitution" come into place:

 - Any DAO may create a new "Digital Constitution" and becoming a Governing DAO.
 - Governing DAO must provide "constitutional court" and "citizenship registry" providers.
 - Treasury of a Governing DAO becomes a Digital State Budget
 - Governing DAO may decide on the tax contribution for some operations between DAOs or Digital Citizens.
 - Other DAOs may elect to enter into binding obligations under Digital Constitutions. That means that Count would have access to DAOs treasury if DAO would violate the Digital Constitution.
 - Should DAO choose to leave area of "Digital Constitution" they would incur penalty (defined by Governing DAO)

Digital Citezenship:
 - "citizenship registry" is an off-line facility provided by Governing DAO for issuing and revoking  "Citizen Tokens" - making sure that every citizen has just one token.
 - Each citizen accumulates 'Power toknes' which they can legally use once they reach voting age.
 - Citizens may decide to burn Power tokens to show their political support for a party DAO, motion, petition or keep their tokens if they are unhappy with the governance at the moment.
 - Additional universal income may be provided to citizens based on exports (Oil, Gas or other valuables) or leasing national resources (e.g. railway, power lines, broadband) no corporations.

Escape mechanism:
 - Organisations or Citizens will always have ways of leaving "Digital Constitution" or switching to a different Governing DAO if their rights are opressed.


Based on the core structure the following would be possible to be implemented:
 - Instant tax - no need for accountants - tax is deducted right away and calculated automatically. All organisations and citizens under Digital Constitution have to pay tax fairly.
 - Personal Information Safety - each citizen is responsible for the safety of their Digital Citizenship token. If they loose it, they can get it re-issued. Token can also be used for authentication, however will provide no personal details about the individual.
 - DAOs may have a complex mechanisms of managing their internal monetary structure, however all financial movements should be approved by the board members.
 - DAOs may pay salaries to citizens - unless it is properly registered with a citizenship token - a "financial export fee" may incur.


Financial import and Export fees
 - DAOs under the same Digital Constitution will be encouraged financially to trade and receive benefits of Governing DAO.
 - Any financial assets leaving the area of Digital Constitution will incur a "financial export" fee, but will not be forbidden.
 - Governing DAO may create trade agreements with other Governing DAOs creating exceptions for financial import/export fees.

## What is the state of the project?

Project has been started in 2021 and has been in active planning phase as well as discussed with various fields of applications as well as researching technological fields.

We are now ready to start the development process.

## How will this project earn money?

The exact process is not defined, but there could be some financial contributions from all Governing DAOs which the core team would be supporting technically.
